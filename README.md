## 🎯 Customization

Most content can be customized in the `data` object at the top of `App.jsx`:

const data = {
name: "Your Name",
role: "Full Stack Developer",
tagline: "One line about what you do.",
about: "A short bio about you.",
location: "Your City, Country",
email: "you@example.com",
github: "https://github.com/yourusername",
linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername",
skills: [ "React.js", "Node.js", "MongoDB", "JavaScript", "Tailwind CSS" ],
projects: [
{
title: "Ecommerce Store",
tech: "React, Node.js, MongoDB",
description: "Short description of the project.",
link: "https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-store"
},
// more projects...
],
};

You can:

- Replace demo projects with your own GitHub repositories.
- Update skills to match your stack (React, MongoDB, Node.js, Oracle, etc.).
- Add or remove sections as needed.
